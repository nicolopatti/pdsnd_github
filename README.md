### Project Title
Projecyt title: **Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Description
Description
This project focuses on analyzing data from bike-sharing systems to uncover patterns in usage. Using datasets provided by Motivate, a prominent bike share system provider in major U.S. cities, the code compares bike share usage across three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.

Project Overview
Bike-sharing systems have become increasingly popular in cities worldwide. These systems allow users to rent bicycles for short periods, providing flexibility to pick up a bike at one station and return it at another, or even at the same station for a leisure ride. With advancements in technology, users can easily unlock and return bikes via automated docks, generating valuable data in the process.

This project leverages such data to:
	•	Analyze usage patterns across different times of the day, days of the week, and user types.
	•	Compare bike-sharing system behavior in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
	•	Provide insights into trends and user behavior that can be useful for stakeholders and city planners.
